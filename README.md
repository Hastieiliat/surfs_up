# surfs_up
Module 9
## Overview of the analysis: 
For this module, we want temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
## Results: 

In this section, I will provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. 
### June

1. The average tempreture in June is 74 with std 3 and in December is 71 with std 3. 
2. However the number of the data in June is 1700 but in December is 1517. That shows in June, we have more information.
3. Both of the data for June and December show that the curve is right handed side which means we have more data between 65 to 75 for June and 55 to 70 for December. 
## Summary: 

In this section, I will provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

For June we have the tempreture between 65 to 85

also in 2017 the observation is the picture below, which shows the tempreture 75 we have more data.
